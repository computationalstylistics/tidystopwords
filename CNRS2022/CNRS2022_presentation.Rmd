## Overview

* Stylistic fingerprint
* Authorship attribution at a glance
* Stylometry as a tool to assess language change



##

<h2 class="shout">Fingerprint</h2>



## The notion of stylistic fingerprint

* An area between language constrains and a freedom of choice
* Undiscoverable with the naked eye
* Beyond authorial control
* Resistant to imitation, plagiarism and parody
* Popular solution: **frequencies of the Most Frequent Words**





## Words are not distributed evenly

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. 
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. 

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” 
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 

“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” 
Mr. Bennet made no answer. 

“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently. 
“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” 
This was invitation enough. 





## Function words = frequent words

**It** **is** **a** truth universally acknowledged, **that** **a** single man **in** possession **of** **a** good fortune, must **be** **in** want **of** **a** wife. 
**However** little known **the** feelings **or** views **of** **such** **a** man **may** **be** **on** **his** first entering **a** neighbourhood, **this** truth **is** **so** well fixed **in** **the** minds **of** **the** surrounding families, **that** **he** **is** considered **the** rightful property **of** **some** one **or** other **of** **their** daughters. 

“**My** dear Mr. Bennet,” said **his** lady **to** **him** one day, “**have** **you** heard **that** Netherfield Park **is** let **at** **last**?” 
Mr. Bennet replied **that** **he** **had** **not**. 

“**But** **it** **is**,” returned **she**; “**for** Mrs. Long **has** **just** **been** here, **and** **she** told **me** all **about** **it**.” 
Mr. Bennet made **no** answer. 

“**Do** **you** **not** want **to** know **who** **has** taken **it**?” cried **his** wife impatiently. 
“**You** want **to** tell **me**, **and** **I** **have** **no** objection **to** hearing **it**.” 
**This** **was** invitation enough. 


## Word frequencies as language features

raw occurrences of words:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data(novels)
xx = sort(table(unlist(strsplit(tolower(novels[[4]]), "[^A-Za-z]+"))), decreasing = TRUE)
xx[1:14]
```

relative frequencies:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
round(xx[1:14]/ sum(xx) * 100, 2)
```




## Rank/frequency dependence

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(as.numeric(sort(table(unlist(strsplit(tolower(novels[[4]]), "[^A-Za-z]+"))), decreasing = TRUE))[1:300], ylab = "frequency", xlab = "rank", col = "brown")
```






##

<h2 class="shout">Authorship attribution</h2>





## Non-traditional authorship attribution

Given:

* a text of uncertain or anonymous authorship, and
* a comparison corpus of texts by known authors,

is it possible to find the **'nearest neighbor'**
among the available candidates?







## Example: _The Cuckoo's Calling_

* A debut by an unknown author Robert Galbraith
* Only 1500 copies sold
* Supposedly written by J.K. Rowling




## Stylometry: where it (usually) begins

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data(galbraith)
rownames(galbraith) = gsub("_[0-9]+", "", rownames(galbraith))
round(galbraith[1:20,1:8], 2)
```




## Table of computed distances

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
round(as.matrix(dist.delta(galbraith)), 4)[1:20,1:3]
```




## Hierarchical cluster analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## Multidimensional scaling

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "MDS", titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## Bootstrap consensus tree

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
stylo(frequencies = galbraith, gui = FALSE, analysis.type = "BCT", mfw.min = 100, mfw.max = 1000, titles.on.graphs = FALSE)
```



## Supervised machine-learning approach

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
cat("Testing a given candidate against imposters...\n
coben \n
lewis \n
rowling \n
tolkien \n\n")
imposters(galbraith)
```




## Stylometry beyond authorship attribution

* Authorship profiling
* Forensic linguistics
* Register analysis
* Genre recognition
* Gender differences
* Translatorial signal
* Early vs. mature style
* Style evolution
* Detecting dementia
* ...









## 

<h2 class="shout">Language change?</h2>



## Aim of the study

* Introducing **a method** to trace changes in language
* **No a priori assumptions** as to the change-makers
* Identifying **the impactful words** over time
* Application on the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)




## Langauge change

* There’s no clear definition of language change
* A more feasible approach: tracing changes in language.
* Any two text compared exhibit differences (e.g. in word frequencies), the same applies to any two samples of a language.
* A provisional definition: a language change is an accumulative effect of significant changes in a language.



## 

<h2 class="shout">The dynamics <br/> of change</h2>






## The dynamics of language change

* Purely linear trends – not very probable.
* Rather, epochs of substantial stylistic drift follow periods of stagnation. 
* The goal: observing the accelleration of language change.





## What is responsible for a change?

* A relatively small number of words that reflect changes in societies?
    * (e.g. _horse_ > _automobile_ > _car_)
* A aggregation of _numerous_ features of individually weak discrimination power?
    * (e.g. the signal of authorship)





## Data and methods

* Corpus of American Historical English (COHA)
    * ca. 400 million words
    * different genres (_fic_, _mag_, _news_, _nf_)
    * covering the years 1810-2009
* A supervised classification
    * Nearest Shrunken Centroids classifier
    * 1,000 most frequent words

## Why does the change periodically accelerate?

* A **naive assumption** that the change can be linked to particular events in history and/or culture.
* However, the impact of major historical breakthroughs on language **cannot be ruled out**.

## Conclusions

* The language change seems to be a **fluctuation** of rapid and slow changes.
* **Numerous features** responsible for the change, rather than few strong predictors.
    * unexpectedly many **pronouns** among the predictors
    * increasing power of "social" function words (personal pronouns)
* Grand question: do we observe a **language** change, or a change in **style**? (e.g. a general taste of an epoch)
